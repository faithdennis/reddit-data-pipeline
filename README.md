## Repository Structure

The final project contains this starter setup. 

```
.
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── 0-checkpoint.md     # Outline of the checkpoint submission
├── 1-final-report.md   # Outline for your final report
├── code/               # Place to put code, scripts, etc.
├── data/               # Data directory (excluded from git)
├── queries/            # Place to put SQL queries
```

**Warning:** It can be tricky to work with large files and git / GitHub. We've set up a `.gitignore` to exclude many common large files, and **everything** inside `data/`.
