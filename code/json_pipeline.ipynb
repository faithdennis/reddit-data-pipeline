I figure since we're at the very start of the subreddit (and presumably love the uniformity of APA style), let's talk about posting articles in a somewhat similar manner so those who come in the future will follow suit.  It seems as though creating google documents is a popular idea as are links to PDFs.  Thoughts on those/other suggestions?  \\n \\nIn order to encourage discussion, I also think that it would be a good idea to say *something* about the article you are posting.  You could mention interesting findings, questionable methods, or just something that you thought was neat.  Articles not posted in this manner would still be published of course, but I really feel as though a sentence or two would really lead to more discussion.  Oh, and posting the abstract there too!

Topics I am NOT interested in: counseling&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am really hoping that someone has experience with this type of problem and can help guide me! &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'First off, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit- I can repost to /r/psychology instead if need be, just let me know please =)\\n\\nSo here\\'s the deal- I\\'m close to finishing up my first semester of my four year of undergrad. I only realized last semester that I really am incredibly enthralled with psychology- I\\'m currently really, really enjoying social psychology, and from the description of it, I think I\\'m really going to enjoy Industrial Organizational psychology which I\\'m planning on taking next semester. \\n\\nThe problem I\\'m facing right now is that I had a horrible first year and a half, so basically my GPA is rather suckish- 3.14 (pi!). I\\'m also not a Psychology major, only a minor, because it took me so long to figure out that that\\'s what I wanted to do. \\n\\nI really want to go on to grad school, and I would prefer not to take time off if I can avoid it. I just took my GRE this morning and meh, I think I did alright. So here are what I see my options right now. I\\'ve spoken with my psych adviser, and with my personality type, interests, and goals, we think I could flourish as an I/O psychologist. I\\'m very hesitant to apply to I/O psych programs without having even taken an undergrad class in it. That same professor(my adviser) is an I/O psychologist, and told me I should apply to be on her research team after I take her class this spring. \\n\\n**A)** Scramble in the next two months to identify a program I would enjoy and excel in, apply, and hope to get good letters of rec from professors who know me as a dedicated student, but not much beyond that. **Downside:** I don\\'t feel I have the grades, research experience, or strong enough recommendations to get into a desirable program given how extremely competitive they are. \\n\\n**B)** Stay another year in undergrad, finish my major in Psych, apply and hope to land a research assistant job, form a relationship with an I/O psychologist, and work to receive outstanding recommendations from her. **Downside:** My parents have generously supported me through my four years in undergrad, and I am now completely on my own financially. Another year in undergrad would fall completely on my shoulders to the tune of about $15-20k plus living expenses. This financial burden scares the everliving crap out of me.

I only realized last semester that I really am incredibly enthralled with psychology- I&amp;#39;m currently really, really enjoying social psychology, and from the description of it, I think I&amp;#39;m really going to enjoy Industrial Organizational psychology which I&amp;#39;m planning on taking next semester. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem I&amp;#39;m facing right now is that I had a horrible first year and a half, so basically my GPA is rather suckish- 3.14 (pi!). I&amp;#39;m also not a Psychology major, only a minor, because it took me so long to figure out that that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to do. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I really want to go on to grad school, and I would prefer not to take time off if I can avoid it. I just took my GRE this morning and meh, I think I did alright. So here are what I see my options right now. I&amp;#39;ve spoken with my psych adviser, and with my personality type, interests, and goals, we think I could flourish as an I/O psychologist. I&amp;#39;m very hesitant to apply to I/O psych programs without having even taken an undergrad class in it. That same professor(my adviser) is an I/O psychologist, and told me I should apply to be on her research team after I take her class this spring. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A)&lt;/strong&gt; Scramble in the next two months to identify a program I would enjoy and excel in, apply, and hope to get good letters of rec from professors who know me as a dedicated student, but not much beyond that. &lt;strong&gt;Downside:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t feel I have the grades, research experience, or strong enough recommendations to get into a desirable program given how extremely competitive they are. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B)&lt;/strong&gt; Stay another year in undergrad, finish my major in Psych, apply and hope to land a research assistant job, form a relationship with an I/O psychologist, and work to receive outstanding recommendations from her. &lt;strong&gt;Downside:&lt;/strong&gt; My parents have generously supported me through my four years in undergrad, and I am now completely on my own financially. Another year in undergrad would fall completely on my shoulders to the tune of about $15-20k plus living expenses. This financial burden scares the everliving crap out of me. Despite this, the only real reason I&amp;#39;m not entirely set on this option, my mother is very, very against me staying another year and spending (&amp;quot;wasting&amp;quot;) the money on something she thinks is pointless. She doesn&amp;#39;t think it will make any difference in my ability to gain entrance into a desirable graduate program, and that I should just go to wherever I get in. She has no experience in graduate education, and is just going off of her firm &amp;quot;undergraduate takes four years&amp;quot; script.

I'm looking for a well-paid job, per se, but it doesn't particularly have to be that. I have always loved helping change people's lives, talking to them about personal issues and helping solve/overcome them, the brightness in there eyes as they realize that they are human, and completely wonderful. I just want to know where I should start. Is clinical psychology the right way to go?

There are dozens of different majors I could get at University, but I&amp;#39;m not sure which one. I&amp;#39;m looking for a well-paid job, per se, but it doesn&amp;#39;t particularly have to be that. I have always loved helping change people&amp;#39;s lives, talking to them about personal issues and helping solve/overcome them, the brightness in there eyes as they realize that they are human, and completely wonderful. I just want to know where I should start. Is clinical psychology the right way to go? Should I do some other form of study that would help me further my career and allow me to reach out to others?\\nTL;DR What field of psychology should I study?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It wouldn't exactly be ethical, not to mention a sane idea to have a no condom condition.\\n\\n-Is the experiment in theory unethical? I don't plan on having random people partake in intercourse and then rate their sexual satisfaction. The idea was that they would be randomly assigned to treatment conditions and they would need to rate their sexual satisfaction after having sex.\\n\\n-Would it be a good idea to randomly assign individuals to treatment conditions and they alone rate their sexual satisfaction, while the partner is not a participant? Or is there anyway to assign the couple to one treatment condition and consider it random assignment?\\n\\n. Due to the fact that subjects will be using the condoms and rating their sexual satisfaction on their own time, wherever they please, however they please would this raise questions of internal validity? It would be hard to say that their level of satisfaction was not due to the temperature of the room, the sexual positions, the woman's ovulation cycle, etc.\\n\\nLast question I promise! Just popped into my mind. Would a better idea be to compare the type of condom as opposed to brand? If so, could the no treatment control condition be a generic, normal condom? and then the other treatment conditions would be textured condoms, ultra thin condoms, etc?\\n\\nThank you :) Any other suggestions are appreciated and welcome.\",\n",

That levels of processing do affect false recall and recognition - that the deeper we process something the less likely we should be to falsely recall items, due to having encoded the information more accurately. Meaning deeper processed items will have a positive affect of false recall, and that false recall will be lower.\\n\\nAnd\\n\\n2. That levels of processing do affect false recall and recognition, due to explanations related to association and activation. Being that, the deeper we process something, the more activations/associations of similar items it will create; therefore meaning deeper levels of processing would actually create a higher number of false recalls/recognition of items - which is surely a negative thing?\\n\\nDoes that sound correct? I have to pick one side of the arugement and find research to back it up, from my current research I think I am going to agree with number 1, however, I’m struggling to entirely understand the articles I’ve used so far; Read (1996), Rhodes &amp; Anastasi (2000), Thapar &amp; McDermott (2001) and Tussing &amp; Greene (1997). \\n\\nJust wondering if anyone had any advice, tips, or input on the question that might help me!

Meaning deeper processed items will have a positive affect of false recall, and that false recall will be lower.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;That levels of processing do affect false recall and recognition, due to explanations related to association and activation. Being that, the deeper we process something, the more activations/associations of similar items it will create; therefore meaning deeper levels of processing would actually create a higher number of false recalls/recognition of items - which is surely a negative thing?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Does that sound correct? I have to pick one side of the arugement and find research to back it up, from my current research I think I am going to agree with number 1, however, I’m struggling to entirely understand the articles I’ve used so far; Read (1996), Rhodes &amp;amp; Anastasi (2000), Thapar &amp;amp; McDermott (2001) and Tussing &amp;amp; Greene (1997). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just wondering if anyone had any advice, tips, or input on the question that might help me! Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I am a student that generally sits at the back of class, doesn&amp;#39;t talk in class and don&amp;#39;t really interact with the professor at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What are some ways for me to develop relationships with professors to the point where they are able to write me letters of recommendation? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also if im going to grad school for research purposes, would producing independent research be valuable for my application? Cause I have some ideas for research that i could do, what would be the significance of doing this research relative to my GPA / letters for my applications? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also if some people have gone through the grad school application process, any wisdom / insight at all would be great if you care to share&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I've been tasked with identifying a strengths-based survey to administer to adults to organize a broad community level intervention.  The project is geared towards decreasing binge drinking among adults (21-44). Initially, I was steered towards measurements of well-being ([Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale](http://www.healthscotland.com/documents/1467.aspx) - WEMWBS and [Ryff's Scales of Psychological Well-Being](http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/ryff-scales/) - RPWB), but they tended to be too narrow in scope or too long. I would think that Canada, NZ, Australia, the UK, Norway, Sweden, or Finland would have something, but initial searches are striking out. I'm looking for something that is free, ~20 questions or fewer (not 40+), is entirely positively worded, uses a 3 or 4 point likert scale, and has a requires a reading level of about 6th grade (or can be administered by phone easily). \\n\\nPlease point me in a helpful direction, provide me your thoughts, or both. \\n\\nThank you in advance!\",\n",

You basically just look at pictures of people and rate their femininity/masculinity, then you rate a handful of personality traits, then rate your feelings about androgynous people. It would be super helpful to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the link &lt;a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KG2V7Y5\"&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KG2V7Y5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you decide not to take it, that&amp;#39;s okay. But I&amp;#39;d really appreciate upvotes at least, just so this can get more exposure.\\nThank you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

The data points can be any numbers you want as long as there are twenty of them.  You will then use the descriptive statistics option in Excel, which is explained in your text, you should get an output similar to figure 1.2.  This output should contain the mean, standard error, median, mode, standard deviation, sample variance, kurtosis, skewness, range, minimum, maximum, sum, count.  Be sure to begin your discussion by reporting your results for each of these values.  Based on this output which single value best describes this set of data and why?

I have been googling like crazy and have had no luck! As well, no mentor or person in my life that is a psychologist, so I&amp;#39;m left to figuring this out on my own. Currently completing my Undergrad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1) Price of a Masters in Psychology (in Canada)?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;2) Price of a Doctorate in Psychology?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3) Length of the Psychology Masters program?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;4) Length of the Psychology PhD program?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also, any insider knowledge current psychologists feel that every prospective grad student should know?\\nI feel like I should be doing so much more, but am stuck with a lack of insider knowledge! Google can only take one so far...&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I majored in Political Philosophy, Policy and Law thinking that I would do law school or journalism. I've since decided that I've lost a great deal of interest in politics because discussing it and thinking about it generally makes me unhappy. It just seems like everyone has so many ideas of what's wrong with the world and so many angry people have so many ideas of how to fix it. It was just making me crazy.\\n\\nIn my final semester, after FINALLY completing my graduation requirements, I took two psychology courses just for fun (Intro to Cognition, Youth &amp; Violence). And I realized I fucking loved it. I now realize that I've picked the wrong major and I want to go into graduate school for psychology. I have worked my ass off for my GPA and I know I'm smart enough, but I don't know if I'll even be considered for admissions without experience. Now, here's my situation, by the numbers:\\n\\n* GPA: 3.6 in a distinguished major - might not seem high, but at UVA, average GPA is 3.1\\n* GRE's yet to take\\n* I am a minority (I hear that's a good thing for some programs)\\n* Work experience: I've worked for newspapers and broadcast news since I was 16 years old. I've also worked at a university gym, a sandwich shop, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management as a clerk. I am a very hard worker and I've never had a moment in my life since I was 16 where I was unemployed. Obviously, however, I have no clinical experience... \\n* I would have very strong recommendations if I asked for them. My thesis advisor and other professors would be happy to write one for me.\\n\\nI really do think that clinical psychology interests me. I have always felt passionate about the field, but I never had the option to play that out. I transferred from William and Mary in my third year and was basically suck in my major once I did. Anyways, from here what can I do? I talked to a professor and he told me that I might consider post bac's or other coursework. Should I apply to post bac's (deadlines are May 1)? Should I just try to get a masters in counseling instead? Should I try to get research experience? My professor also told me few people would be willing to take me on without any experience... But then how do students get their experience? I do plan on taking the GRE's soon. I have a full year before graduate applications are due, so I do have some time. At the end of the day, I would really like to be working with and helping people.\\n\\nI know this is incredibly broad, but anyone have any advice?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I'm currently working on my thesis and while my advisor is great, I seem to be having an issue understanding exactly what she wants and expects, so I was wondering if some other professors/students could help point me in the right direction.. \\n\\nI am interested in looking at the relationship between reactions to the disclosure of one's non-heterosexual sexual orientation, social support, and psychological health.  Previous studies that have looked at disclosure reactions have either done so qualitatively, or used a simple 3-point Likert scale (Was this reaction good, bad, or neutral).  Therefore, I have actually gone through the trouble of creating my own scale.  It looks at a multitude of things, including the relationship to the person, the closeness of the relationship (both before and after the disclosure), the type of disclosure (verbal, non-verbal, outed, etc), and the age of the person coming out at disclosure (which can also be used to examine the length of time passed between disclosure and current relationship closeness).  \\n\\nBasically, my problem is that I have NO IDEA how to validate this scale since there really isn't anything out there within the LGBT literature.  I came across the Social Reactions Questionnaire which measures disclosure reactions, but it's for the disclosure of sexual assault, so I don't think it would be appropriate to use (and especially not for a large community sample). I've tried finding scales on changes in relationship closeness, but everything that comes up tends to be for interpersonal/romantic relationships which is too specific for what I'm looking at... \\n\\nCan anyone help point me in the right direction on what I should be looking for please?  I already have the Outness Inventory (Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2000) as well as the Coming Out Growth Scale (Vaughan &amp; Waehler, 2010) but I don't think they're sufficient for a true validation. \\n\\nAlso, I should probably note that while yes, ideally I could run a pilot study before I collect my data to help work out the kinks, but unfortunately, I live in a very conservative area. As such, in order for me to collect enough LGBT participants, I have to collect data in a little over a month as it's the only time during the year that we have such a large and diverse sample of LGBT individuals to pool from. \",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I'm new to reddit and very new to this sub/reddit but i was looking for a place to talk about this idea I've had for a few years. I've always had a huge passion for psychology and education but a big problem with the public education in America. It always seemed to me that you only went to school to make you more prepared for school... like you only go to kindergarten to get to grade school and you go to grade school to go to middle school then to high school and so on, and some where in that time you are supposed to understand the world we live in and become a responsible adult and a contributing member of society. My main focus is on the high school years although i feel this principle could be implemented much earlier. Just as a forewarning i've only had high school psychology/sociology education and just the little bit i have read on my own so if i'm missing something huge here tell me about it and i don't claim to understand everything that goes on from 9th grade until 12th in a persons body/mind. I feel that we treat our teens as kids right up until they are legally adults and this creates a big problem, lack of accountability. I feel that is caused by a lack of responsibility in the persons life, yet when they screw up as an adult we treat them as such. This is an injustice because we have not properly ushered them in to adulthood and i think we should start much earlier than those few years before age 18. Think back to your high school days, hating school, never wanting to be there, finding any reason to skip, never studying...that explains a majority of the kids i knew in high school, they never cared about their grades or their attendance and i believe it comes from a lack of responsibility because when you got an F on a test or skipped class the worst you got was a call to your mother/father so all you had to do was learn how to deal with your parents and by the age of 15 you are usually pretty good at that. So... on to my actual idea, I would like to see a school implement a program where in grades 9-12 we give the students progressively more and more responsibility in regards to their own high school careers such as, when they skip give them a 0 for the day but don't call mommy/daddy explain to them how that affects their over all grade and how hard it is to come back from a 0 and then let them decide, when they get a failing grade on a test do the same, let them decide if they want to sleep in class or listen to music during an assignment... writing it down it seems pretty far fetched and i'm sure it would be a rare sight to see today's students actually taking to this but i think it's possible and we should give them more credit, my 14 year old brother when given the opportunity for responsibility grabbed at it and i believe that, that stems from his need for praise and most teenagers have that same need. Sorry this is poorly written but i've never actually written this idea down before, remember I have no formal psychology/sociology schooling it's just a passion of mine and i would like thoughts on this\",\n",

For others and for myself. As an artist this will be my project. I feel that this is the ideal path for me because the school schedule will give me time to work on my music and graphic design on the side.

       "  'selftext': 'Hi AcademicPsychology Redditors, \\n\\nThanks for looking at this wall of text. I majored in Japanese (BA) during undergrad at university, with a 3.8 GPA. Spent the last two years teaching, and realized it\\'s not for me. I\\'m curious about applying to graduate Psychology programs (I\\'d like to study IDD [intellectual and developmental disabilities]). Long term goal: I would prefer to work with clients, rather than do academic research. I have a personal interest in psychology (received treatment for  major depression, ongoing), but no academic background or professional experience. Currently I\\'m studying for the GRE aptitude and GRE Psych, reading up like crazy, and researching programs. \\n\\nSo, I have some questions about applying to PhD programs this fall. (I plan to apply again fall 2014, since I doubt I will be accepted anywhere the first time around.) Thank you very much for reading this :)\\n\\n1. Is it a significant disadvantage to start a psychology Ph.D. program at 27 years old? I.e., \"too late\"? \\n\\n2. I realize I very likely may not get into a Ph.D. program for Fall 2013. Therefore, I plan to volunteer at a hospice or community center of some kind, while taking psych and stat classes. Do these classes need to be at a University? Or, is a junior college sufficient? \\n\\n3. How do I go about contacting psychology professors at Universities, asking to work under them? (I\\'m especially nervous, because I have zero connections. This is a complete change of field for me.)\\n\\n4. Random, but I would like to know: when you were in graduate school, what made you want to quit? What made you want to stay? \\n\\n5. I don\\'t have talent in regards to math and the sciences. I always got A\\'s in those subjects; however, I had to study hard for tests. I can learn and retain information in those subjects, but it requires a lot of effort on my part. It does not come naturally. For such a person, is it possible to survive a psych Ph.D. program?\\n\\nI was never the smartest student in my undergraduate classes, but I am an extremely hard worker. I am willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal, even if it kicks my ass, and makes me cry like a little child (which I\\'m completely expecting). Nevertheless, I could really use some guidance. \\n\\nThank you very, very much!! I\\'m sorry if anything was convoluted; I currently have a nasty head cold. I hope you have an awesome day :D',\n",

I'm an intern at American University's new [Center for Religion and Civic Life](http://www.aumethodists.org/crcl/), and one of the goals for our new Center is the creation of a university publication for student and faculty research on issues on the intersection of religion and civic life. \\n\\nI'm asking around different subreddits to see if other students/professors at different universities have any experience with university publications, whether they be student run or otherwise. We're looking for any information you can give us: What content do you publish, and who contributes? How often does your publication run? How long is it? How many submissions? Who funds it? Is it primarily online or is it in print? \\n\\nWe're looking to get ideas for our own publication, so anything is helpful! Links to the webpages of the publications themselves are VERY helpful (in fact, that would probably be easiest for both of us). Additionally, if you have any experience working on one of these publications, feel free to offer advice, stories, or just describe your experience.\\n\\nThanks so much!\",\n",

I&amp;#39;m an intern at American University&amp;#39;s new &lt;a href=\"http://www.aumethodists.org/crcl/\"&gt;Center for Religion and Civic Life&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the goals for our new Center is the creation of a university publication for student and faculty research on issues on the intersection of religion and civic life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m asking around different subreddits to see if other students/professors at different universities have any experience with university publications, whether they be student run or otherwise. We&amp;#39;re looking for any information you can give us: What content do you publish, and who contributes? How often does your publication run? How long is it? How many submissions? Who funds it? Is it primarily online or is it in print? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re looking to get ideas for our own publication, so anything is helpful! Links to the webpages of the publications themselves are VERY helpful (in fact, that would probably be easiest for both of us). Additionally, if you have any experience working on one of these publications, feel free to offer advice, stories, or just describe your experience.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I'm hoping to eventually become accredited with the CPA so I've made sure that all of my potential programs meet that requirement. However, I'm currently working in a private practice as an intern and had some questions about the way extended health coverage works. In my current practice clients are able to use their extended health coverage to see master's level counselors because the practice in general is under the supervision of a registered clinical psychologist. This means that all those working under the C.Psych's supervision pay her a considerable percentage of their earnings for her supervision services. I'd like to know if a PhD in counseling rather than clinical psychology would allow me to offer psychological services independently of a registered clinical psychologist, or if I'd still require a C.Psych's supervision (which would essentially put me in the same position as a master's level counselor). The provinces I'm considering practicing in are Ontario and Nova Scotia if that makes any difference, although I doubt it does since both the CPA and most extended health coverage providers are national entities.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hello all,\\n\\nI just finished my MA Psychology degree in the spring of 2012. My concentration was Evolutionary/Social. Through my entire master's program I was all about research. I conducted and developed numerous research projects and was pushed by my colleagues and advisers to apply for PhD programs. They always said I'd be a success at the PhD level.\\n\\nI am currently studying for GRE's to boost my score. Additionally, I have tons of research projects/experience, conference experience, some teaching experience, and I am working on getting a paper published. The thing is... after all the research I've done on PhD programs, I am not sure I want to go or if it is even worth it.\\n\\nYou see, I don't want to be professor and I know that's the expected track for PhD graduates. I enjoy research tremendously, and I know I could be an okay/good professor, but I know it would not make me happy. I find that I am happiest when I am either creating experiments or analyzing data alone or with close colleagues. Yes, I am an introvert by nature. I even find conferences somewhat cumbersome.\\n\\nI do know that some PhD grads work outside of academia, but then I wonder if the investment in loans and time is worth it if my end goal is to work for a company, government, etc...? I am currently $40k in debt from my master's degree. After a PhD degree, the debt would increase between $100-$150k I assume. If tuition reimbursement and stipends pay for the program, I am still unsure if it's the route I want to take.\\n\\nAdditionally, I wouldn't start my career until my early to mid 30's. I am 27 right now. I also hear it is tough for PhD graduates to attain a job outside of academia because of the perception of being overqualified or less trainable compared to a Bachelor's or Master's graduate.\\n\\nI still plan on taking the GRE's again, continuing research at my alma mater, and going to a few conferences this year, but I have been slacking on all of these things since I have come to to this realization.\\n\\nI feel strongly about making a career out of human resources and perhaps if I want my PhD down the line, enroll in an online PhD program for I/O Psychology. I've also tossed around the idea of starting a career in law enforcement in the hopes of one day being a detective. That would be my second choice, though all law enforcement jobs in my area have been on a hiring freeze for years.\\n\\nI have also considered going back for a bachelor's degree in stats. I think that would likely help me out tremendously. It is also a lot more economical than a PhD, and I could see a greater and quicker return on investment.\\n\\nThen there's the fact of trying to get hired somewhere. I have applied for 500 jobs since mid spring, and have had only two interviews. I recently got rejected for a research position at a research hospital after two strong interviews. I am currently waiting to hear back from a human resources internship at a regional bank that has contacted me. I'm crossing my fingers on that one.\\n\\nAny advice from PhD students, graduates, professionals or anyone of what I should do?\\n\\nThank you in advanced!\\n\\nTL;DR - Recent MA Psych grad, unsure if he should apply for PhD programs. Enjoys research/analysis, but does not want to work in academia. Some ideas discussed above. Advice?\",\n",

I don&amp;#39;t think the content matters too much other than it needs to be psych related, interesting, and something I can engage and interact with the &amp;quot;students&amp;quot; on.  I&amp;#39;m having trouble picking a topic and need a few easy interactive ways to demonstrate it.  Any help would be appreciated.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  &lt;strong&gt;There will not be a classroom of actual students, just the 3 people interviewing me.&lt;/strong&gt;  I don&amp;#39;t think I made that very clear.  I appreciate all the comments, you guys are giving me some great ideas for class.  I hope I get the job!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2:  I decided to do Fundamental Attribution Error with an activity similar to cjazz108&amp;#39;s money suggestion.  &lt;strong&gt;Thank you so much for all your help!&lt;/strong&gt;  It really helped me come up with a demo I think will work well.  And now I&amp;#39;ve got some great ideas for class, too.  I&amp;#39;ll let you know if I get the job.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 3:  I got the job!!

I&amp;#39;ve been in enough studies myself to know that a poor video clip can really impact how you perceive the information conveyed; however,  I go to a small school and don&amp;#39;t really have AV geniuses as friends so I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Psych researchers of reddit, do you have any ideas of how to tackle this issue?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I have quite a number of articles that relate to the effects of highlighting, but none that actually seperates the kinesthetic act from the visual impact. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to look for articles that relate movements per se with enhancing attention/encoding/learning/memory, but I am having no luck.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Can the good people of reddit help me out? Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: I need research articles relating movements with enhancing attention/encoding/learning/memory&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Feel free to post here, pm, or email me at mcs2213@columbia. edu. \\n\\nJust so you know, I have of course already been searching through academic journals and articles - feel free to post/pass on those, but I am looking for information beyond studies and articles as well, including first hand experience (as a practitioner, professor, or program director). I appreciate any help or info you lovely Redditors can provide. \\n\\nThanks! \\n\\n',\n",

I want to practice as a psychologist working with kids but first I want to teach children for at least 5 years before I settle down and just own my own daycare center. \\nI am kinda freaking out about the GRE. The study classes that are offered are so expensive. So, I've been just doing free online studying, and I was wondering is it worth it to take the GRE? Should I pay for the classes to study for preparation? \\n\\nTL; DR  Spent my undergrad years away from everything I know and love should go away from my family again? Or is going away again a good decision? Is it worth it to take the GRE? Should I pay for the classes to study for preparation? \",\n",

I graduated college in 2012 with a major in Legal Studies in Business and a double minor in Psychology and Spanish. After ~6 months of working in the business world, I've realized that I made a mistake. I want to be a therapist, but one that specializes in a very under-served field. I want to be a women's sexual dysfunction therapist (I'm not even sure if that's the right way to phrase it). I want to help women who suffer from vaginismus, dyspareunia, vulvar vestibulitis, anorgasmia, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, etc. I'm only interested in treating women with these sexual issues.\\n\\nMy passion behind this comes from my own struggles with vaginismus, which I recently overcame this past summer. After 8 years of painful and embarrassing physical therapy, I found the lack of emotional support very detrimental to my mental health. I struggled with major depression and suicidal thoughts because of my problem. Vaginismus isn't something you can talk about easily with others. To have to hide that (huge) part of my life was very taxing for me, and I tried to seek out therapy to help cope. However, out of the ~20 therapists I saw, not one - not ONE - even knew what vaginismus was. That was very discouraging for me.\\n\\nI want to be that emotional support for women who are struggling with this painful and embarrassing medical issue. The problem is, I don't even know someone who does that for a living to ask for advice. What kind of program should I look for? How do I specialize in sexual dysfunction? Where should I intern? Is this worth pursuing?\\n\\nIf anyone can give me advice, I'd be really appreciative. I'm not even sure what type of schooling I'd need to reach my goal. I just want to help!\",\n",

Some background here: I am a sophomore at a pretty good STEM school, that is an honors university and is well known for its undergrad research opportunities and its hard classes. I am currently pursuing a BS instead of a BA because I heard that they are respected more when it comes to graduate programs. But I am starting to second guess that because math and chem have never been my strong suits and because of this, I have gotten 3 C&amp;#39;s so far, and it is really dragging my GPA down. Of course since it is an honors university, and a STEM school, my math and science related classes are much harder, especially for me, but it is still no excuse for my C&amp;#39;s. If I were to pursue a BA, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to take so many science classes and I would have to take more humanities classes which I am much better at. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is this; is it really worth it to stick through and get a BS instead of a BA even if it means my GPA will suffer?

In 6th grade, I did a science fair project about trying to decipher human fear response the visual appearance of dogs (specifically, what it was about a dog's appearance that provoked fear in different populations, which I looked at by creating composite images of different “looks” of dogs and asking people to rate their fear of the dog in the image).

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi r/academicpsychology, I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with some ideas the past few days and I was wondering if I could get some quick direction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First a bit about me: Recent Philosophy grad, top of my class. Specialization in metaphysics and, to a lesser degree, epistemology. I love academia, and plan to go to grad school. My intention was philosophy, but my passion has been tempered by these reasons, among a few others:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor prospects getting into a funded philosophy program. There is about a 300:1 apps-spots ratio into funded programs right now, which is higher than it has ever been in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;God-awful job prospects post-doc. A liberal estimate is 1% of PhD graduates are getting &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; academic position, which is really the only position that uses a philosophy degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some personal issues with the current trend in philosophical investigation that leave prime advisors practically non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All of this brings me to the door to Academic Psychology as a possible academic haven, which leads me to my question:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Is work still done in meta-psychology (epistemology-type work) or has that been a phase overcome in the early days of psychology?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I find myself interested in the epistemic framework that surrounds the science of psychology. In what way does cognitive science connect to psychology? How do research methods develop and change as the dominant view of how the brain works evolves, and can there be scientific methodology to guide this (or are we just stuck with Kuhnian scientific anarchy)?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All these questions just become more acute and complicated with the rise of more realistic brain models and our ever evolving definition of identity. I can come up with a few more questions, but I think that adequately establishes my interests.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Is there any hope for this type of work?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hi r/academicpsychology, I've been playing around with some ideas the past few days and I was wondering if I could get some quick direction.\\n\\nFirst a bit about me: Recent Philosophy grad, top of my class. Specialization in metaphysics and, to a lesser degree, epistemology. I love academia, and plan to go to grad school. My intention was philosophy, but my passion has been tempered by these reasons, among a few others:\\n\\n1. Poor prospects getting into a funded philosophy program. There is about a 300:1 apps-spots ratio into funded programs right now, which is higher than it has ever been in philosophy.\\n\\n2. God-awful job prospects post-doc. A liberal estimate is 1% of PhD graduates are getting *any* academic position, which is really the only position that uses a philosophy degree.\\n\\n3. Some personal issues with the current trend in philosophical investigation that leave prime advisors practically non-existent.\\n\\nAll of this brings me to the door to Academic Psychology as a possible academic haven, which leads me to my question:\\n\\nIs work still done in meta-psychology (epistemology-type work) or has that been a phase overcome in the early days of psychology?\\n\\nI find myself interested in the epistemic framework that surrounds the science of psychology. In what way does cognitive science connect to psychology? How do research methods develop and change as the dominant view of how the brain works evolves, and can there be scientific methodology to guide this (or are we just stuck with Kuhnian scientific anarchy)?\\n\\nAll these questions just become more acute and complicated with the rise of more realistic brain models and our ever evolving definition of identity. I can come up with a few more questions, but I think that adequately establishes my interests.\\n\\nIs there any hope for this type of work?\",\n",

With that, at what degree of confidence do psychologists prescribe a child's stated gender to their legal/institutional gender? For example, what are the requirements and guidelines that psychologists use to suggest a change of gender on a birth certificate?

I already talked with a professor whom I\\'ve taken her class and work in her lab with my idea.  My idea starts with these independent variables:\\n\\nGender x attractiveness x personality\\n\\nAnd then conditions would lay out like this:\\n\\n* male-attractive-nice\\n* male-attractive-not nice\\n* male -unattractive-nice\\n* male- unattractive- not nice\\n* female-attractive-nice\\n* female-attractive-not nice\\n* female-unattractive-nice\\n* female-unattractive-not nice\\n\\nWith the funds, I plan on hiring a male and female confederate and a makeup artist (ideally).  If both confederates are by default attractive, then the makeup artist would turn them into the appearance of unattractive by implementing scarring, deformity, acne, etc.  The makeup artist is for the sake of consistency as for using the same confederates.  \\n\\nThe basic procedure I\\'d have in mind is come up with a cover story, have the confederate follow a script, the participant is interviewed for irrelevant topics, and have the participant rate the confederate before and after interaction.  My professor suggested giving a scale for the participant to rate the confederate\\'s attractiveness and personality **before** interaction to avoid confounding personality and attractiveness.  After interaction, the participant is given the same scale to rate the confederate\\'s attractiveness and personality.\\n\\nThe types of results I expect to find are in the participants\\' responses such as: (**Before interaction**) What are your first impressions of this interviewer?  Rate the attractiveness of the interviewer.  Rate how positive or negative does the interviewer appear to be.  (**After interaction**) *Same questions with the exception of* \"Did you notice any facial imperfections of the interviewer?\" \"If so, how long did it took for you to notice?\"\\n\\nWhat I wanted out of this experiment that can be generalized is if personality trumps over physical appearance in first impressions.  Say Person A is sitting and Person B is interviewing.  Before the interviewer ever interacts with A, A is given a scale to rate his first impressions of what A thinks of B\\'s personality and attractiveness.  Hypothetically, before interaction, B is unattractive and shows neutral personality, so A rates B as unattractive and has a negative personality.  However, after interaction, B is conditioned as positive so A is predicted to rate B as possibly more attractive and/or changes his first impression of B to having a positive personality.  As far as pointing out facial imperfections go, I also want to know if having a positive personality will delay the participant from noticing facial imperfections VS having a negative personality will make the participant let his eyes wander and attempt to find facial imperfections.\\n\\nMy professor warned me that such an experiment with 8 conditions will prove to be very difficult, yet thinks there might be some studies already conducted with similar independent variables.  Also, she told me that it will be difficult to keep the conditions from confounding each other which is why I\\'m doing my best to find articles that have done such a experiment.\\n\\nTherefore, what I\\'d like to ask of the users of this subreddit is to help me point the direction toward the types of articles that have done such an experiment (because I\\'m sifting through keywords of personality AND gender AND attractiveness and finding results to be related to symmetry, manner of dressing, etc.)  Or if there has been any researcher who can be named and has published his/her studies.  Or if any personality researcher in this subreddit can give me input into whether such an experiment is possible.  Anything else can be asking questions about my idea so I can go back and think over what to change or consider alternatives to tweaking the experiment (such as removing personality and just focus on gender x attractiveness).',\n",

I was wondering people had any thoughts or opinions on my topic that might help me put things together in a more formal way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To start, much of my training has been spent doing drug and alcohol counseling in both community mental health centers and on college campuses. Because of the nature of drug and alcohol counseling most of my work has also been done with clients mandated to treatment.

As I see it, one of the main differences between mandated therapy and voluntary therapy is that in mandated therapy the treatment goals are at least partially dictated by the referring agency. immediately this puts pressure on the therapist to change various behaviors of the client, often pitting the therapist (who is invested in change) against the client (who may be invested in not changing).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective technique for inciting change in mandated clients and has been acclaimed for it&amp;#39;s non-directive approach to treatment. At first glance MI appears to take an accepting stance towards treatment. The stance of MI and the techniques utilized are about &amp;quot;rolling with resistance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;resolving ambiguity&amp;quot; in a non-confrontational way. And yet, the purpose of &amp;quot;rolling with resistance&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;resolving ambiguity&amp;quot; within an MI framework is to get the client to make a commitment to change. Though various MI techniques may look like acceptance, the &amp;quot;accepting stance&amp;quot; is used as a tool to incite change, which, is not acceptance at all. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though I use MI quite often, and believe it is an extremely power and effective technique for motivating mandated clients to change various behaviors, I don&amp;#39;t really feel like there is any acceptance or &amp;quot;radical&amp;quot; acceptance happening in the sessions. To me, MI feels like just really sophisticated tactics to get the client to change in a way that I and the referring agency see fit.

But for a number of months now, I have been interested in and trying to piece together information about an obscure branch of psychology that has very little in the way of publicly available information regarding its existence. If anyone is more familiar with or interested in the subject, please chime in. I first heard of theoretical psychology while investigating branches of psychology for a project from its wiki page &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_psychology\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, there is little more there than a stub. What I&amp;#39;ve managed to piece together follows:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theoretical and philosophical psychology are fairly closely linked and from what I can tell they primarily differ in their direction of inquiry. If I should refer to the two as one field it is because they are rather hard to separate. In theory they act as meta-disciplines don&amp;#39;t typically tend to concern themselves directly with investigating the mind, but rather the field of psychology. That is to say they examine such things as the epistemological and ontological assumptions that underlie the field. Theoretical psychology alternatively may be viewed as being comparable to theoretical physics: using rational methods rather than empirical methods for its inquiry. The idea may strike many at least in the American psychology community as blasphemous, but few if anyone in the field would regard their work as being an adequately complete endeavor by itself. Empirical work would later be needed to support any theorizing. Many working in the field even look down upon theoreticians creating theories, they feel their role should to look at work being done and try to decide whether the inductive claims being made by researchers in their studies are justified by their research or where flaws in methodology lie. It is relatively hard to come by a simple definition for what the fields do, rather they seam to have become a catchall for a lot of different kinds or research that fall outside of &amp;quot;mainstream psychology&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"http://theoretical-psychology.blogspot.com/2011/09/mainstream-psychology.html\"&gt;A pretty good explanation of what I mean by mainstream psychology can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. An article summarizing the fields&amp;#39; APA division from the APA monitor on psychology can be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb05/closer.aspx\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: I don&amp;#39;t intend to address the debate over the legitimacy of this effort here, such would demand an entire thread, and I don&amp;#39;t feel myself capable of doing such a defense justice.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Within the United States the fields&amp;#39; main representative body is &lt;a href=\"http://www.theoreticalpsychology.org/\"&gt;APA Division 24&lt;/a&gt;. The field made a good deal of progress through the middle part of the 20th century, but it&amp;#39;s been struggling as of late. APA Division 24 is down to about half of their membership peak in 1993 and they&amp;#39;re seeing relatively few young people entering the field &lt;a href=\"http://www.theoreticalpsychology.org/aboutus3.html\"&gt;See Fall 2010 Presidential Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Simply as a matter of personal opinion, a large part of the issue and part of what inspired my to write this post, may be that they&amp;#39;ve done a less than stellar job of maintaining visibility. With little information available outside a number of academic journals, it is a miracle I even stumbled across it in the first place. I fear that at least in America they may be in danger of being read out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of the US there appears to be slightly better prospects for those interested in studying and working in the field. There was an article in an Australian publication awhile ago that did an empirical investigation into the status of the field in Australia that did a great job of showing some of the views towards it over there and detailed a number of advancements it had made. I&amp;#39;m going to try to find it when I get the chance. From what I can tell, the Canadian psychology community seems to have been most receptive of the countries I&amp;#39;ve seen (I can&amp;#39;t speak to any countries in the eastern hemisphere).

I suspect that the problem is that participants (intro psych students) weren't taking the experiment seriously. The experiment was on numeracy and medical decision making, and it's likely that the combination of math and general fatigue from the sessions usually being on a school day undermined any possible results.\\n\\nHowever, since this is my thesis, I still have to do a full write-up of everything, and I'm having trouble with the results section.\\n\\nIs there a proper way to write a results section (and discussion, for that matter) when one hasn't found significance? Is there a way to properly communicate my worries about the limitations I listed above without sounding unprofessional?\\n\\nThank you for any advice.\",\n",

I plan to approach her again (which I have before, discussing about my academic plans) to see if she is willing to write a reference letter as well for when I start applying for volunteer positions. Also, when is a good time to approach professors for these things?

Although I have yet to get familiar with their work (i will soon), I emailed them letting them know my interest and let them know I plan to start volunteering Spring 2014 (when I raise my GPA and get more knowledge).\\n\\nThey asked for a CV, and to be honest, I'm not sure how to tackle that since I don't even have ANY experience. I've worked in hospitality industry since high school, that is it. I am only finishing my first year. I'm not too sure how I can approach this. Also, I have bad GPA, a lot of Cs/C+ and even an F from a couple of years ago. Although I'm doing better now (last semester, and this semester), I can't help but feel like that's going to hinder my situation.\\n\\nAny thoughts/advice?\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nNote: my abnormal psyc/stats teacher recently emailed me out of no where mentioning my efforts in his class as well as my EDUC professor (she's a educational psychologist) who has stopped me after our last class to let me know how she really enjoys my research paper and she has thought about it a couple of times. I plan to approach her again (which I have before, discussing about my academic plans) to see if she is willing to write a reference letter as well for when I start applying for volunteer positions. Also, when is a good time to approach professors for these things? I still can't help but feel like even 2 classes isn't appropriate. \",\n",

I&amp;#39;m thinking about going into a clinical PhD program (hopefully!) directly after I get my B.S. I e-mailed all of my psych professors at my new school (I&amp;#39;m transferring after this semester to another university) and asked about research opportunities so I could get involved from the beginning of my time there (I will be there two years). The only one who has availability for a research assistant this summer/upcoming fall is the legal psych professor. He said I could work with him long term on projects until I graduate and even though I&amp;#39;m not interested in legal psychology, I will learn important skills and he will teach me everything he knows. While I am interested in primarily clinical research, I was wondering if this opportunity is worth it? Or would you recommend waiting around for a position with the clinical psychology professor? Also, would you say that if I began work with the legal psychology professor first, that would hurt my chances of getting an assistant position with the clinical professor later on (they may give it to someone who hasn&amp;#39;t had experience yet or something)? Is even okay to leave another professor&amp;#39;s reserach for another&amp;#39;s? I just want to make sure I&amp;#39;m doing the right thing to put me on track - any advice is welcome on this.

What other information would you need to evaluate the research properly?) Turn in both the article and your discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So yea! I just need help finding the articles and cartoons (especially the cartoons since they can only be as far back as January.. )\\nI will be doing the summaries of course but like I said.. I need help finding those articles and cartoons! Thanks so much!!! I greatly appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

If you are out there and you have any qualification whatsoever in taking about psychopathy, please private message me. I need to do an \"interview with an expert\" which could be a phone call, a skype date, or even just an email response. I don\\'t have many questions and they don\\'t go too into depth, but I just need something. Your focus doesn\\'t even need to be on psychopaths, as long as you think you could at least attempt to answer my questions. I promise it won\\'t take too much of your time. Thank you in advance.',\n",

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I&amp;#39;m an undergrad looking to write up and carry out a research proposal as part of my psych major in undergrad study. I have six ideas I&amp;#39;d like to do but in the interest of time, I&amp;#39;ll just post the two I&amp;#39;ve gotten the most positive feedback about.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first idea is a study of the psychology of ethics and a well known moral dilemma known as the trolley problem. For those who haven&amp;#39;t come across it, the gist of the problem is as follows: If a train is bearing down on 5 people and the only thing that can be done is for you to hit a lever that switches the tracks and consequentially kills 1 person - what do you do? It&amp;#39;s basically a test of a persons morals as far as how much they value the lives of innocent people against their beliefs in fate and circumstances of justifiable homicide.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Four hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 1: People will be more willing to kill indirectly than otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 2: People will value quantity of lives over quality of lives. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 3: People will undermine hypothesis 1 and 2 if they have an emotional stake in the victim (mostly if it is family or a person of importance). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 4: In hypothetical contradictions, at the extremes, people will value quantity, then victim identity, then directness of personal involvement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Independent variables:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Quantity of people involved &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Victim identity &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Directness of the act.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;ll be a survey with the control being the original 5 vs 1 question and experimental being variations of it like;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing the way the act must be done (indirectly like pulling a lever or directly like pushing them off a bridge)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing the ratio of people involved (10 to 1 or 5 to 2 or 4 to 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the 1 person someone of particular sympathetic or social value (as in a president or a nun or something)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dependent variable:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Whether the person switches the trains tracks or not, as measured by their answers. It&amp;#39;ll be straight yes or no answers with a prompt something along the lines of &amp;quot;do you do it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I am hesitant to do this study is that it feels too ambitious compared to my other ideas and I am worried I&amp;#39;ll be writing out of my depth - I&amp;#39;ve been looking at studies done by other students for this project and a lot of them seem like very basic tests of the fundamentals of psychological research. This, by comparison, seems almost like a philosophical study, shaped in the mold and medium of psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I like this proposal is that I&amp;#39;ve always been interested in the logic and problem solving mechanics of morality and I think there is something to be learned in a study of how the average person balances the value of other lives against variables like fate and personal responsibility. While potentially tenuous, I think the tie between this study and psychology can be satisfactorily supported if I delve into the psychology of motivation a little and really analyze the data for how the responses I receive would or would not agree with preexisting research on why people make the decisions they do, as far as acts of altruism or disengagement are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How willing are people to change their behavior slightly and temporarily to make the lives of others easier? I read a study some time ago about phone booths and how people actually tend to take longer to leave them when they know someone is waiting in line. It&amp;#39;s completely counter intuitive to the concept of social pressure and courtesy one might expect to assert itself in such a situation, but I feel like there might be something to be studied here. Phone booths are basically extinct in my area so I thought I would just apply this concept to parking lots and the question of whether people are more or less willing to exit a parking space if they know someone is waiting adjacently for it. I would compare these results against the responses I receive to a survey about what they think they would do. Namely, I would be watching students park in the commuter lot at my school and put out a survey for commuters at my school to answer about whether they think they are faster or slower to give up spaces when they know someone is waiting behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 1: People will be slower to exit a parking space if they know someone else is waiting for it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis 2: People will think they are faster to leave a parking space if they know someone else is waiting for it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Independent variable:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Presence of others&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if this should be nominal data (are there other people or not) or interval (how many people are waiting in the lot), because I&amp;#39;m not sure if addressing whether there are more people than just the parker and parker-to-be would affect the data.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dependent variable:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How long it takes the person to leave the space, from turning the engine on to being far enough to allow the second party to park&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little hesitant to do this because I have totally and utterly failed to find the original study, nor any body of work I could study to draw up plans from. The only thing psychinfo kicks back about phone booth is about some study on dimes which, while interesting, has nothing to do with what I&amp;#39;m researching here.

       "  'selftext': 'Hi everyone, I\\'m an undergrad looking to write up and carry out a research proposal as part of my psych major in undergrad study. I have six ideas I\\'d like to do but in the interest of time, I\\'ll just post the two I\\'ve gotten the most positive feedback about.\\n\\n**Idea 1**\\n\\nThe first idea is a study of the psychology of ethics and a well known moral dilemma known as the trolley problem. For those who haven\\'t come across it, the gist of the problem is as follows: If a train is bearing down on 5 people and the only thing that can be done is for you to hit a lever that switches the tracks and consequentially kills 1 person - what do you do? It\\'s basically a test of a persons morals as far as how much they value the lives of innocent people against their beliefs in fate and circumstances of justifiable homicide.\\n\\nFour hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 1: People will be more willing to kill indirectly than otherwise. \\n\\nHypothesis 2: People will value quantity of lives over quality of lives. \\n\\nHypothesis 3: People will undermine hypothesis 1 and 2 if they have an emotional stake in the victim (mostly if it is family or a person of importance). \\n\\nHypothesis 4: In hypothetical contradictions, at the extremes, people will value quantity, then victim identity, then directness of personal involvement.\\n\\nIndependent variables:\\n\\n* Quantity of people involved \\n* Victim identity \\n* Directness of the act.\\n\\nThere\\'ll be a survey with the control being the original 5 vs 1 question and experimental being variations of it like;\\n\\n* Changing the way the act must be done (indirectly like pulling a lever or directly like pushing them off a bridge)\\n\\n* Changing the ratio of people involved (10 to 1 or 5 to 2 or 4 to 3)\\n\\n* Making the 1 person someone of particular sympathetic or social value (as in a president or a nun or something)\\n\\nDependent variable:\\n\\nWhether the person switches the trains tracks or not, as measured by their answers. It\\'ll be straight yes or no answers with a prompt something along the lines of \"do you do it?\"\\n\\nThe reason I am hesitant to do this study is that it feels too ambitious compared to my other ideas and I am worried I\\'ll be writing out of my depth - I\\'ve been looking at studies done by other students for this project and a lot of them seem like very basic tests of the fundamentals of psychological research. This, by comparison, seems almost like a philosophical study, shaped in the mold and medium of psychological research.\\n\\nThe reason I like this proposal is that I\\'ve always been interested in the logic and problem solving mechanics of morality and I think there is something to be learned in a study of how the average person balances the value of other lives against variables like fate and personal responsibility. While potentially tenuous, I think the tie between this study and psychology can be satisfactorily supported if I delve into the psychology of motivation a little and really analyze the data for how the responses I receive would or would not agree with preexisting research on why people make the decisions they do, as far as acts of altruism or disengagement are concerned.\\n\\n**Idea 2**\\n\\nHow willing are people to change their behavior slightly and temporarily to make the lives of others easier? I read a study some time ago about phone booths and how people actually tend to take longer to leave them when they know someone is waiting in line. It\\'s completely counter intuitive to the concept of social pressure and courtesy one might expect to assert itself in such a situation, but I feel like there might be something to be studied here. Phone booths are basically extinct in my area so I thought I would just apply this concept to parking lots and the question of whether people are more or less willing to exit a parking space if they know someone is waiting adjacently for it. I would compare these results against the responses I receive to a survey about what they think they would do. Namely, I would be watching students park in the commuter lot at my school and put out a survey for commuters at my school to answer about whether they think they are faster or slower to give up spaces when they know someone is waiting behind them.\\n\\nTwo hypotheses:\\n\\nHypothesis 1: People will be slower to exit a parking space if they know someone else is waiting for it. \\n\\nHypothesis 2: People will think they are faster to leave a parking space if they know someone else is waiting for it.\\n\\nIndependent variable:\\n\\n* Presence of others\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if this should be nominal data (are there other people or not) or interval (how many people are waiting in the lot), because I\\'m not sure if addressing whether there are more people than just the parker and parker-to-be would affect the data.\\n\\nDependent variable:\\n\\nHow long it takes the person to leave the space, from turning the engine on to being far enough to allow the second party to park\\n\\nI\\'m a little hesitant to do this because I have totally and utterly failed to find the original study, nor any body of work I could study to draw up plans from. The only thing psychinfo kicks back about phone booth is about some study on dimes which, while interesting, has nothing to do with what I\\'m researching here. I\\'ve tried researching articles on social facilitation but nothing I\\'ve come across comes close to what I want to do here. There\\'s also the looming doubt I have about whether or not I\\'ll get any actual results - I know there\\'s nothing necessarily wrong with not getting results that support an interesting hypothesis and this is probably just my immaturity as a student speaking but I would hate to spend a year researching something only to not get results.\\n\\nThe reason I\\'m interested in doing it is that it just seems like something that would be fun and easy to do and relatively unusual compared to what my peers are doing. I commute to school myself and I\\'ve always had the suspicion that people momentarily turn into selfish assholes when they have to watch someone take their space, even if they don\\'t need it anymore because honestly, the parking situation at my school isn\\'t that great and people get pretty territorial over spaces they have to fight to get at 8AM.\\n\\n----\\n\\nSo what do you guys think? Which idea would you recommend I do? Which one would you be more interested in reading? Can you point me to any resources or previous studies that would help me in my research? Have any of you done these proposals before?\\n',\n",

In each, there is attention deployment on the rote repitition of a mantra (chant phrase), which is a sutra (line of text; sentence) which embodies that archetype.

Which is the ability to delay a tempting stimulus so one can get a bigger reward later, f.e. resist taking 1 marshmellow now so you&amp;#39;ll receive 2 marshmellows as a reward 15 minutes later (for more detials; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification\"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification&lt;/a&gt;). How would you explain this phenomenon from the viewpoint of the strength model? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This model sees self-control as a limited resource that gets depleted when you use it, in the same way a muscle gets tired when exercised. Would you say that from this models viewpoint the delaying gratification paradigm would be explained as due to depletion, which is caused by the mental &amp;quot;struggle&amp;quot; to not cave for the smaller treat? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And, how does the strength model compare to the CAPSystem in it&amp;#39;s ability to explain self-control? Or is this just another case of competing explanations which doesnt has an unified theory yet? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1 Muraven, M., &amp;amp; Baumeister, R. F. (2000).

       "  'selftext': 'Hi, \\n\\nThis is my first time posting in this sub so if this is the wrong place for a discussion like this, my sincere apology. \\n\\n\\nI\\'m writing a paper on self-control at the moment and I\\'m a bit mentally stuck now and was hoping that some discussion could help my brain juice flow again ;) While I was comparing the strength model of self-control (Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000) with the cognitive affective processing system (CAPS, Mischel &amp; Adyuk, 2004), I stumbled upon the delayed gratification paradigm. Which is the ability to delay a tempting stimulus so one can get a bigger reward later, f.e. resist taking 1 marshmellow now so you\\'ll receive 2 marshmellows as a reward 15 minutes later (for more detials; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification). How would you explain this phenomenon from the viewpoint of the strength model? \\n\\nThis model sees self-control as a limited resource that gets depleted when you use it, in the same way a muscle gets tired when exercised. Would you say that from this models viewpoint the delaying gratification paradigm would be explained as due to depletion, which is caused by the mental \"struggle\" to not cave for the smaller treat? \\n\\nAnd, how does the strength model compare to the CAPSystem in it\\'s ability to explain self-control? Or is this just another case of competing explanations which doesnt has an unified theory yet? \\n\\n\\n1 Muraven, M., &amp; Baumeister, R. F. (2000).

Please complete BOTH. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HZglA32n65senIXKMENRZ8DJfexpLigd9B8vYdw5WiE/viewform\"&gt;1-10th of the month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1w72cLjYWTP-LHgDGpqytIqGQDBh8s-_ZygxMqqPNWXw/viewform\"&gt;11-20th of the month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oDfOx_VUVgeBivo8bBMmLYwQM8X7BKMV-833CI9gPfk/viewform\"&gt;21-31st of the month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again!

I just started working in a developmental/clinical \\n lab last semester (my bad, I know this is a bit late to start learning more about research). I only did some basic work in the lab since I am a new RA: entering data, running participants…etc, so I did not paricularly enjoy or dislike my RA position. I also ask my lab advisor many research-related questions- I hope he will give me more challenging work in the future. In my free time, I read psychology articles from different fields (social, clinical, neuropsych, developmental) and I find myself enjoy articles from the clinical psychology field the best, especially about developmental psychopathology. But honestly, I do not feel passionate enough to conduct research for the rest of my career and I cannot really imagine myself being an academic (perhaps this is partly related to my lack of research experience?).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My career goal:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love to help people directly, especially children- I always wanted to be a therapist or a clinical psychologist. I volunteer for many years in a community center that are for children with developmental problems and I absolutely feel that is my element. I also volunteer in a suicide hotline and I find this kind of work very meaningful. My goal is to open a private practice that targets children and teenagers with psychological problems. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilemma:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my question- which route should I pick: PhD, PsyD, or MSW (Masters in Social Work)? I understand PhD is not absolutely suitable for me since I am that into research (or even know much about research) and the competition for clinical psychology is very intense- so I must take years off to gain much more research experience before applying. But as many people have advised me, most psych PhD programs are at least partly funded and this means I won&amp;#39;t have much student loan by the time I graduate. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it seems that PsyD program is a better fit but it is very expensive. I absolutely don&amp;#39;t want to have a huge student loan. The thing is my parents said they can lend me money with no interest to pay my school fee every semester (they are quite wealthy- still this is very generous of them). I am conflicted whether I should borrow money from my parents for my PsyD. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And for masters, I am not sure whether it is possible to have my own private practice (I live in California, if that matters). I heard that if I only get a masters, I have to work under a psychologist at any time. Does anyone know more about this? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading and please give me some advice of any kind! I really appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

But as many people have advised me, most psych PhD programs are at least partly funded and this means I won't have much student loan by the time I graduate. \\n\\nOn the other hand, it seems that PsyD program is a better fit but it is very expensive. I absolutely don't want to have a huge student loan. The thing is my parents said they can lend me money with no interest to pay my school fee every semester (they are quite wealthy- still this is very generous of them). I am conflicted whether I should borrow money from my parents for my PsyD. \\n\\nAnd for masters, I am not sure whether it is possible to have my own private practice (I live in California, if that matters). I heard that if I only get a masters, I have to work under a psychologist at any time. Does anyone know more about this? \\n\\nThank you so much for reading and please give me some advice of any kind! I really appreciate it!\",\n",

I've been reading the posts popping up recently with similar questions to mine, so I thought it's about time I ask this. :)\\n\\n\\nHere's my situation: I'm sure I want to clinically practice. Up until pretty recently, I was dead set on going for the PsyD because of the greater emphasis on clinical training and the lesser influence on research. I don't mind doing research, but it's just not my main line of interest. Anyway, I've been reading lots of information about PhD programs vs PsyD programs, and it seems to me that a lot of people with PsyD's end up with an enormous amount of debt while many PhD programs waive tuition and pay you a small amount. I also know that you can still clinically practice with a PhD. It seems to me that the PhD is the better option financially by a long shot for what I want to do.\\n\\nMy worry is that I wouldn't enjoy it as much. As I said before, I don't mind research at all, but it's not my favorite thing either. I'm currently working with a professor on his research (just started about 2 months ago). I'm enjoying it so far, but it's not very intensive or time consuming at the moment, so I don't know how it would change my feelings towards it if it got more demanding. I know that your life IS research in a PhD program, so I'm wondering if my indifferent attitude wouldn't work for me. I'd still give it my 100%, I just don't know if I'd be enjoying myself as much as I should be. I picture the ideal PhD student to be in love with research and that's just not me.\\n \\n\\nSo I guess I want to know, would it be a bad decision if I choose the clinical PhD instead of the PsyD because it will save me from debt? Or, even better, has anyone made this decision, and did it work out? If this is the worst idea you've ever heard, please feel free to tell me. Thanks in advance for any responses that I get! \",\n",

       "  'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not familiar with comics then you likely won&amp;#39;t know who the Joker is(well maybe). The Joker is Batman&amp;#39;s archnemesis and a very popular super villain. What makes hims so popular is how insane he is. When I say he&amp;#39;s insane, I mean the guy is out of his fucking mind, he&amp;#39;s a murdering psychopath, that can flip on anyone and anything at the drop of a hat and has a body count in the thousands. I can&amp;#39;t stress to you how crazy the Joker is. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But what makes this relevant and the question I&amp;#39;m asking is how the Joker got to be how he is. The Joker really has no set origin but the most widely accepted is that he was a criminal called the Red Hood that fell into a vat of chemicals that gave him into his clownlike appearance. But the most widely accepted origin is that he was a struggling comic that got mixed in with some criminals. That comic unfortunately got the aforementioned chemical bath. This event warped his mind and drove him insane and he officially became the Joker. But what makes the Joker so unique is not only his insanity, it&amp;#39;s his genius way of executing his schemes.

       "  'selftext': \"If you're not familiar with comics then you likely won't know who the Joker is(well maybe). The Joker is Batman's archnemesis and a very popular super villain. What makes hims so popular is how insane he is. When I say he's insane, I mean the guy is out of his fucking mind, he's a murdering psychopath, that can flip on anyone and anything at the drop of a hat and has a body count in the thousands. I can't stress to you how crazy the Joker is. \\n\\nBut what makes this relevant and the question I'm asking is how the Joker got to be how he is. The Joker really has no set origin but the most widely accepted is that he was a criminal called the Red Hood that fell into a vat of chemicals that gave him into his clownlike appearance. But the most widely accepted origin is that he was a struggling comic that got mixed in with some criminals. That comic unfortunately got the aforementioned chemical bath. This event warped his mind and drove him insane and he officially became the Joker. But what makes the Joker so unique is not only his insanity, it's his genius way of executing his schemes. Most of his plans are very well thought out and intricate and psychological in nature. For instance he paralyzed Batgirl who was the daughter of police commissioner Gordon and then eventually murdered his wife just to prove a point. He viciously killed one of the Robins with a crowbar and frequently reminds Batman that he did so. \\n\\nSo the question I guess I'm asking is do we have a little bit of the Joker inside of us? Meaning if pushed over the edge can we end up a murdering genius psychopath like him?\\n\\nEDIT- if you'd like to have an idea of the Joker's genius/insanity: http://youtu.be/EGd1BSw767k?t=5m23s\",\n",
